#enumerate() is a function that you use with a for loop to get the index (position) of that list item, too.
#remember the class excerise where we all stoop up and told our positions 

#zip() is a function that you use with a for loop to use each item in multiple lists all at once 
#you can bring them together

#while loops as long as the answer to the question is yes
#we provide a way for the while loop to end 
#conditionals are key to the while loop
#while loops you need a yes or no question
